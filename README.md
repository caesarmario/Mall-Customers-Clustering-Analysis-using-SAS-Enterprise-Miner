## 🖋 About Project:
> This dataset contains dummy mall customer data such as customers' basic information and spending score. It is required to group mall shoppers into several groups based on their behavior to understand their shopping habits to get an effective and efficient marketing strategy using SAS Enterprise Miner.

  <ul>
  <li><b>Cluster 1</b>: This cluster has customers with the lowest spending score distribution, which is similar to cluster 2. However, most customers in this cluster have medium to high annual income. Customers in this cluster have an age distribution quite similar to the overall distribution, which covers all age groups. When viewed in detail, customers in this cluster are mostly adults to middle-aged adults.</li>
  <li><b>Cluster 2</b>: As previously mentioned, this cluster’s distribution of spending scores is the lowest. In addition, this cluster has the lowest annual income compared to other clusters. Similar to cluster 1, customers in this cluster have age distribution that is quite close to overall distribution and mostly filled with adults to middle-aged adults. However, more than half of the elderly shoppers are in this cluster.</li>
  <li><b>Cluster 3</b>: Customers in this cluster have a fairly high spending score, similar to cluster 5. However, this cluster’s average annual customer income is in the middle. In addition, most of the customers in this cluster are young adults to adults.</li>
  <li><b>Cluster 4</b>: Customers in this cluster have a middle to lower annual income distribution. However, this is inversely proportional to the distribution of spending scores, where the distribution of spending scores tends to be middle to high. The age distribution in this cluster is slightly skewed, where most customers present in this cluster are around 18 years old.</li>
  <li><b>Cluster 5</b>: Customers in this cluster have an average annual income and spending score above the average. Furthermore, this cluster is mostly dominated by adult shoppers.</li>
  </ul>
